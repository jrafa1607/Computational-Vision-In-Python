### 🌟 Project Goals

The primary objective of this repository is to:

* **Consolidate and showcase** foundational and advanced CV techniques implemented in **Python**.
* Provide a **clear, executable, and reproducible environment** for learning and experimentation.
* Offer **direct access** to code, external resources, and references related to each algorithm.

---

### 💻 Technology & Environment

All algorithms were developed and tested using **Google Colab** notebooks. This ensures that the code is easily accessible, runnable, and requires **minimal setup** for users.
* **Python:** The core programming language.
* **Libraries:** Common CV and Data Science libraries, including **OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-image, TensorFlow/PyTorch**, etc.
* **Google Colab:** The primary execution environment (IPYNB notebooks).

### 🗂️ Repository Structure & Contents

This repository is organized to cover a wide range of CV topics. Key areas you will find include:

* **Image Processing Fundamentals:**
    * Filters (e.g., Gaussian, Median, Sobel)
    * Color Space Manipulation
    * Thresholding and Segmentation
* **Feature Detection and Extraction:**
    * Edge Detection (e.g., Canny, Hough Transform)
    * Keypoint Descriptors (e.g., SIFT, ORB)
* **Object Detection and Recognition:**
    * Implementations of classic or simple Machine Learning models for CV (if applicable).
* **Other Resources:**
    * A dedicated section/file for **links, academic papers, and external tutorials** that inspired or relate to the implementations.
